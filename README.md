# Generative-AI-Using-LangChain

This repository contains hands-on tutorials and examples demonstrating how to build generative AI applications using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Through a collection of practical guides and code samples, this repository demonstrates how to build intelligent systems that interact with external data sources, maintain conversational memory, and use tools to perform complex reasoning tasks. Covers implementations such as AI-powered chatbots, document-based Q&A systems, and advanced agent workflowsâ€”offering a solid foundation for working with LangChain.

##  Learning Outcome

- Core concepts of LangChain (LLMs, Chains, Prompts)
- Document loading and vector indexing
- Building question-answering systems over PDFs and text files
- Creating simple chatbots with memory
- Using tools and agents to extend LLM functionality
